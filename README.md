# JumpTo
Chrome extension refreshes the Redgate graph at set intervals - feel free to use, it's a rough and ready bit of code to do a simple job.

To add to Chrome.

1. Build the app and run the project JumpToAnalysisGraphs.
2. Enter chrome://extensions/ in the url address bar.
3. Click on developer mode then click on "Load unpacked extension".
4. Browse to app folder for this project and select.
 
You should see an off icon appear next to the url address bar.

Make sure you uncheck developer mode if you don't require this.
